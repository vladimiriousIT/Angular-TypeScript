# ES2015-Typescript-Tutorial

A new tutorial series on ES2015 aka ES6 and Typescript!

ES6 is the 6th edition, officially known as ECMAScript 2015, and was finalised in June 2015. ES6 adds significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including classes and modules, but defines them semantically in the same terms as ECMAScript 5 strict mode. Browser support for ES6 is still incomplete. However, ES6 code can be transpiled into ES5 code, which has more consistent support across browsers.

Typescript is a superset of Javascript that compiles to plain Javascript. It is also the main language used for Angular 2.
